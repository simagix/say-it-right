Node down since yesterday, customer upset. We tried restart but it didnâ€™t work. Probably 
something wrong with disk. Someone needs to look at it. Reporting broken. 

Customer reports node3 is unreachable since last night, causing reporting failures. Restart 
attempt at 03:00 UTC did not succeed. Primary is still healthy. Impact is intermittent read 
failures. Possible disk issue, needs further analysis. Next shift should check logs and 
decide if node rebuild is required. 

Customer has been unable to read from node3 since 02:14 UTC, resulting in broken reporting 
dashboards. Primary remains healthy and no elections occurred, but the app uses 
secondaryPreferred, so queries often target the down node. Restart at 03:00 UTC failed; 
logs indicate potential disk corruption. Current risk: degraded reads and possible SLA 
breach if sync not restored promptly. Actions so far: restart attempt, monitoring primary 
stability. Next steps: re-provision node3 on a clean disk and re-sync from primary (~2 hours). 
Please update the customer every 30 minutes.
